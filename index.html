        I do not want any pressure on myself to practice these things.
        But when I find that impact in me to continue these practices,
        I WILL. Hopefully, maturely.

                "Surrender - the letting go of mental-emotional resistance
                to what is - also becomes a portal for the unmanifested.
                The reason for this is simple: inner resistance cuts you off
                from other people, from yourself, from the world around you.
                It strengthens the feeling of separateness on which the ego
                depends for its survival."

                    **It is too much. Too much obession with "what was" and "what if".
                    It is excess in its absolute capacity. Therefore, it becomes the
                    opposite of what I am trying to accomplish.

                    **Your <b>"if I felt like I've accomplished it, it means I DID"</b> is not <b>VALID</b>. Because feelings
                    come from thoughts. And thoughts aren't always realistic especially when we suffer from
                    cognitive distortions. Therefore, feelings aren't valid.
